Blog Application
This project is a full-stack blog application built with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. It allows users to read, create, edit, and delete blog posts, featuring user authentication, dynamic navigation, and a responsive design.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

Dynamic Routing: Implemented with React Router for seamless navigation between pages.

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes using modern CSS frameworks.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog_app.git
cd blog_app
Install Dependencies:

Install both backend and frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install frontend dependencies

Set Up Environment Variables:

Backend: Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:

env
Copy
Edit
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Frontend: Create a .env file in the frontend directory with necessary configurations, if any.

Start the Application:

In the root directory, start both the backend and frontend servers:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Start the backend server
npm run dev

# In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start the frontend development server
npm start
The application should now be running with the backend at http://localhost:5000 and the frontend at http://localhost:3000.
